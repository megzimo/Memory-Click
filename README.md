# Memory Game
This application is a game meant to test your memory. Each time you choose a card, all cards will randomly reshuffle. The object of the game is to correctly select all cards without selecting one more than once. For each card selected that has not been chosen, you earn one point. If you click a card more than once, your score returns to zero, and you can replay the game in attempts to beat your high score which is displayed in the top right corner of the application.
